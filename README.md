# Weather-Dashboard-Inna-s-Challenge-6
My name is Inna Mamedova, I am a student of Birmingham University Coding Bootcamp.
In this challenge I have created a weather dashboard using openweathermap.org API.




# Project requirements
Create the aqpplication where user will be able to check the weather outlook for multiple cities.


# Details
I have created a HTML file and used CSS and Bootstart to add the styling.
I have created API key to use it when I will call the weather data.
I have obtained geographical coordinates (lat, lon) by using name of the city.
I have used geographical coordinates to make an API call that would return weather info.
I have used a JavaScript to create additional HTML element and style them.
